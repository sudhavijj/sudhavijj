## 🧪 Projects

Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot share source code from my professional work. However, here is a latest personal project that demonstrates my technical capabilities and interest in FE development and  applied AI:

### 💻 [Angular Essentials Project](https://github.com/sudhavijj/AngularEssentials)

This repository showcases key concepts and best practices for building scalable front-end applications using **Angular**.

**Key features include:**
- Modular architecture and reusable components
- Integration with REST APIs
- Reactive forms and validation
- State management and service-based communication
- Routing, lazy loading, and performance optimizations

This project reflects my frontend development experience from enterprise systems, demonstrating how I build clean, maintainable, and responsive UIs using Angular. It’s designed as both a learning tool and a reference for building production-ready Angular apps.

### 🤖 [Automated Essay Scoring using DistilBERT and CNN-LSTM](https://github.com/sudhavijj/TermProjectAIT726)

This project implements an automated essay scoring system using a combination of **DistilBERT** for semantic feature extraction and a **CNN-LSTM** model for scoring. Built as part of a graduate AI course, the project highlights my skills in both machine learning and web development.

**Key features include:**

- Semantic feature extraction from essays using a pre-trained DistilBERT model  
- Hybrid deep learning architecture (CNN + LSTM) for accurate score prediction  
- A complete training and evaluation pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook  
- A user-friendly **Flask-based web application** for essay input and score visualization  
- Tools used: Python, PyTorch, transformers, Flask, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement practical NLP systems, blending deep learning with intuitive web interfaces.
